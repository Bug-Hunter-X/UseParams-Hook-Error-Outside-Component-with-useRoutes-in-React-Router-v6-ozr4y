In React Router Dom v6, attempting to access the `useParams` hook outside of a component using `useRoutes` can lead to unexpected behavior or errors.  This is because `useParams` relies on the routing context established within a component rendered by the router.  Trying to use it in a function or custom hook called from elsewhere might return `undefined` or throw errors depending on the context.
